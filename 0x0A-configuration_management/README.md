Skynet Auto-Remediation Tool

Background Context

This project is inspired by my experience at SlideShare, where I developed an auto-remediation tool called Skynet. Skynet was designed to monitor, scale, and fix Cloud infrastructure using Puppet, specifically focusing on parallel job execution with MCollective.

Bug Incident

During my time at SlideShare, a critical bug occurred in the Skynet code, causing unintended consequences. When executing commands with MCollective, a nil value was sent to the filter method, resulting in the termination of servers due to a misinterpretation by MCollective.

This incident highlighted the importance of robust coding practices and the use of Puppet for infrastructure management and recovery.
